---
## Introduction
As a Product Leader, it is one of your essential duties to create a product roadmap to ensure product success. But over the time, the roadmaps become a ritual. The true intention behind roadmaps become hazy in the daily whirlwind and the process of creating roadmaps become an intuition of influential leadership decision in a larger organization. Let's try to remember, who is a product leader, what is a product roadmap, how to create it & why is it so important?

## What is Product Roadmap?
The product roadmap is a list of prioritized development milestones of significant product features arranged by monthly or quarterly fashion. It is a high-level summary describing the vision & strategy of a product. It is crafted to help product stakeholders such as customers, investors, executives, customer-facing employees, business leaders, development leaders, human resources & legal to coordinate & plan for what is coming in the future. It enables the predictability of product development. It is the testament of the product stakeholders' alignment & their collective efforts of converting their vision into an execution plan.

As you can imagine, it is a daunting task to create a product roadmap. It involves communication back and forth, understanding business circumstances, financial needs, collective support and etc. There are many prerequisites to create a successful roadmap. First and foremost, it needs a Product Leader, who can bridge between product stakeholders and the teams.

## Product Leader
Simply putting, the role of Product Leader is to improve the product and make it uniquely competitive in the market. Product leaders interact with customers, learn their ways of using the product and how it adds value to them. Customer knowledge is a primary currency of a successful product leader. Product leaders also employ product/ market positioning, company's goal, competitive advantage, strategic and disruptive thinking to help improve the product. It doesn't happen in a vacuum. They work with the various teams such as design, development, sales, executives & investors to understand the company strategy and help build product vision & product strategy around it. Product leaders are like coaches, mentors to the teams. The product's chief strategist and its chief communicator.

## Product Strategy
"Start building a roadmap from Product Strategy". Product strategy describes, how your company will achieve its business goals. It generally answers the below,

- Product Goals
- Target Customers
- Customer needs
- Benefits to Customers
- Competitors
- Differentiators

Strategy-based/ Top-down approach has many advantages to it. It makes it easier to articulate the product vision & strategy and ensure the teams are on the same page as you continue to elaborate the detailed roadmap and eventual release plan. It also helps you clearly see your product's vision and allows you to make decisions throughout the roadmaps that help you achieve the product vision & goals. Product Vision & Strategy are like the foundation of building a home.

## Draft Roadmap
Once the Product Vision, Product Strategy are set, you are ready to build the Draft roadmap. There is no standard format for the roadmap, but it should be easy to understand. The format is less important compared to stakeholders' trust and alignment. It is also important to identify the key stakeholders and consistently seek for their alignment. Great product Leaders are also Great People Leaders. They put people before the process to get the alignment. There are many ways to create alignments such as including stakeholders early in every step of building a roadmap, asking for underlying thoughts, feedbacks and explaining the importance of including others.

> “No alignment, No support!”

Every organization or a company will have leaders who are strongly opinioned & intuitive about their ideas, thoughts on what needs to be built. Sometimes, their intuition works. But often intuition can be faulty. As a product leader, it is important to ensure these intuitions don't derail the Vision, Goals & Stakeholders' alignment. Product leaders should spend time with such leaders at the beginning to channel their energy into a process. Remember, Successful roadmap

- should have Sound strategy
- should be Realistic
- is Full supported

Next step in building a roadmap is to identify the key milestones. Start with your product strategy, Customer research, market research & strategic thinking. Try to imagine the major product change that will help accelerate the product growth towards the desired goals. Milestones are major functionalities; they are not bugfixes and engineering user stories. People often confuse backlog stories with milestones. The backlog queues are small tasks designed for the development team. They don't communicate a high-level summary of product vision & strategy across various teams in an organization/ company. But milestones are eventually converted into backlog stories and worked upon. It is also essential to record every milestone with strategic objective & business benefits. Milestones don't talk feature details, customer specific needs or deadlines. Once you have the draft milestones & product strategy, then conduct reviews and discussions to decide which product factors to create, eliminate, reduce & raise.  

Now that we have the milestones, we need to sequence them & schedule them in the roadmap based on the business priorities & feasibility. You can work with development leaders to understand the development capacity of the teams and estimate the milestones based on their best guess. Remember, the roadmap schedules need not be accurate but should be realistic. It is merely to help communicate the product development plans across the company and coordinate their future plans. Now with the milestones & estimates in handy, go head create a roadmap & sequence your milestones.

## Review and Rollout
Review the Draft Roadmap with the stakeholders and the teams. Start with the Product vision and Product Strategy. Explain how does the roadmap achieve the product vision and how does it implement the product strategy. Explain the goals, go over high-level development capacity & the team. Present the Draft Product Roadmap walkthrough. It is essential to ask for feedback during the review sessions. Ask for what the stakeholders wish differently and modify the roadmaps accordingly. During the review sessions, it is important to show the team the trade-off of any modifications. For example, if a business leader wants to prioritize a milestone, show him the cascading effect of such a modification in real-time. Bring the team together to think about the future success and ensure everyone is aligned.

Now the roadmap is ready to roll-out. Start evangelize the roadmap with the presentation of top-level objectives, target customers, competitive advantages, product roadmap & rationale. Conduct 1-1 with leaders, stakeholders & executives. Roll out the roadmap in a Townhall/ All-hands/ Team meeting with no more than 10 to 15 mins to ensure clarity & audience attention.

There are situations where meaningful product roadmap is not possible. Especially during the early stages of product development. Many times, I have been asked about the product roadmap of early-stage product concepts by my partners and teams. Building a product roadmap without customer knowledge and product/ market fit is not useful. There is no point in building a roadmap without understanding what are we building, how it is going to help the customers & who are our competitors. During the early stage product development, it is important to state the high-level solid product vision & value proposition from the beginning. But once the team has reached the product/ market fit, then that should drive the goals, product strategy & roadmap. Until then the team should continue to learn the market, customers & validate their hypothesis.

## Conclusion
Product Roadmap is a collective team effort and not an individual's intuitive thought process. It empowers every stakeholder & every constituency of an organization by reinforcing their ownership. It is also a reminder of what the teams are aligned & agreed upon. It is also important to understand that the roadmap is a living document in today's dynamic market. It will continue to evolve based on customer needs, desires, new competitor information, development time or other costs and etc. But again, it is important to understand the reason for the change and communicate it across the teams to reacquire alignment.
